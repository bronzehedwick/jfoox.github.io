</figure>Myxozoans are some of the strangest animals that you&rsquo;ve probably never heard of. Comprising a group of over 2,200 species of endoparasites, myxozoans are found embedded in the organs of poikilothermic (cold-blooded) vertebrates such as fish and frogs, as well as many worm-like invertebrates such as oligochaetes, in all aquatic (and even some terrestrial) systems around the world. <strong>Myxozoans are the world&rsquo;s smallest animals</strong>, with the spores of many species as tiny as 10μm &ndash; 1/6th the size of the smallest grain of sand.</p>

<p>Though the majority of myxozoan species are harmless to its host, <strong>some species are well known pathogens that can quickly devastate populations.</strong> These include <em>Myxobolus cerebralis</em>, a parasite of juvenile rainbow trout that causes Whirling Disease, in which degeneration of musculature and spinal tissue causes fish to be unable to swim in a straight line, thus appearing to whirl and chase their tails. Another is <em>Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae</em>, the causative agent of Proliferative Kidney Disease, which can cause up to 90% population loss in farm-reared salmon and trout.</p>

<p><figure style="float:left">
    <img src="/img/morphotypes.png">
</figure>But here&rsquo;s the really strange about myxozoans: <strong>they&rsquo;re very closely related to jellyfish.</strong> Well, jellyfish and their medusa-forming allies, such as box jellies and hydras. One of the few cells that myxozoans bear, known as the polar capsule, is a complex eversible tubule that aids in attachment of the myxozoan to the integument of its host. As it turns out, polar capsules are homologous (evolutionarily united) to the stinging structures (&ldquo;cnidocytes&rdquo;) found uniquely within the phylum Cnidaria (jellyfish, corals, anemones, etc.). Therefore, despite their total dissimilarity in biology, anatomy, ecology, and lifestyle, myxozoans and jellyfish are essentially cousins. Evolution makes for strange bedfellows.</p>

<p>Since their first discovery in the mid-19th century, <strong>the evolutionary position of Myxozoa has been controversial,</strong> and only recently have we confirmed this bizarre position for this group, using a combination of the morphological evidence above and recently available genetic data. I wrote about the history of classification of Myxozoa <a href="http://www.journalofparasitology.org/doi/abs/10.1645/14-671.1" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

    <figcaption>
        <h6>A simplified view of the medusozoan tree. The fully free-living moon jelly <em>Aurelia aurita</em> is sister to parasitic lineages, including (1) the transitionary <em>Polypodium hydriforme</em>, which parasitizes paddlefish and sturgeon eggs before emerging and developing into a free-living stolon; (2) malacosporeans, which are myxozoans but have a complex vermiform bauplan with true musculature; (3) the aforementioned oligocellular myxosporeans. </h6>
    </figcaption>
</figure>The phylogenetic placement of Myxozoa within Cnidaria implies that myxozoans underwent one of the most extreme transitions to parasitism known to biology. Unlike their macroscopic cnidarian ancestors, myxozoans lack true germ layer differential, musculature, a gastrovascular (digestive) cavity, and a nervous network. In fact, a typical myxosporean can be comprised of as few as five cells: 2 valvogenic cells, which form the proteinacious shell encasing the spore; 2+ capsulogenic cells, which create the polar capsules; and a sporoplasm, a binucleated germative cell that begets daughter spores.</p>

<p>For a sense of just how reduced these parasites are, consider this: the size different between a myxosporean and a moon jelly is roughly equivalent to the size difference between you and Mt. Everest. The images on the tips of the phylogeny to the right, of course, are not to scale; if they were, the myxospore would be smaller than a single pixel.</p>

<p>My research focuses on the genetic underpinnings of this reduction. In spite of their extreme shift, what unites myxozoans with their cnidarian allies? How does the genetic repertoire of a polar capsule compare to a nematocyst? And what novel pathways have they developed?</p>

<p>Genomic evolution
Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have allowed genomic data to be produced for non-model organisms such as Myxozoa. Just in the last few years, several studies have generated genomic myxozoan sequences for a number of species (e.g., <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054576" target="_blank">Nesnidal et al., 2013</a>; <a href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/12/3182" target="_blank">Yang et al, 2014</a>; <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/11/13/1511468112.short" target="_blank">Chang et al, 2015</a>). This is an impressive rate of progress, considering that beforehand genetic data were only available for a handful of loci (mainly ribosomal genes) for &lt;1% of known species.</p>

        <h6>Transcripts unique to <em>Myxobolus cerebralis</em>, as categorized by Level 3 Gene Ontology, which can give insight into the unique functional genetics of the Myxozoa.

<p>These data have enabled not only the resolution of the phylogenetic placement of these parasites, but have given us unprecedented insight into the way they function at the molecular level. Using a combination of transcriptomes (protein-coding subsection of the genome that is actively expressed) that I have generated, as well as publicly available datasets, I am working to understand the genomic evolution and functional genetics of the Myxozoa. Recently, I published <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/16/840/" target="_blank">a study describing a way to decouple myxozoan from host sequences in transcriptomic datasets, and did a preliminary empirical study of genomic features and functional genetics of <em>Myxobolus cerebralis</em></a>. In the near future, I will leverage multiple transcriptomic sets in a comparative context to reconstruction evolution of the myxozoan lineage as well as differentiation within Myxozoa itself.</p>
